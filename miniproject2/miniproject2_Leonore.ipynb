    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a model employing ANN on real-world data requires going through several major steps, each of which with important design choices that directly impact the end results. In this project, we guide you through these choices starting from a large database of [Irish folk melodies](https://github.com/IraKorshunova/folk-rnn/tree/master/data) to your own model of symbolic music composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/).\n",
    "- You should know the concepts \"recurrent neural networks\", \"LSTM\", \"training and validation data\", \"overfitting\" and \"early stopping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be guided through a data processing procedure and understand the importance of design choices in ANN modeling\n",
    "- You will learn how to define recurrent neural networks in keras and fit them to data.\n",
    "- You will be guided through a prototyping procedure for the application of deep learning to a specific domain.\n",
    "- You will get in contact with concepts discussed later in the lecture, like \"overfitting\", \"LSTM network\", and \"Generative model\".\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answer sentences. \n",
    "We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook. Please ensure that your notebook is fully executed before handing it in. "

    "For your convenience we import some libraries and provide some functions below. Some libraries (`midi` and `music21==5.1.0`) should be added. If you work with the docker image, pull it `docker pull zifeo/artificial-neural-networks:cpu` before to get the latest version where these libraries are added and stop/relaunch the container (as stated in the instructions https://github.com/zifeo/artificial-neural-networks). If you work locally, be sure to import them. If you do not find the midi library for python3, install it with `python setup.py install` inside the `python3-midi` folder after cloning https://github.com/louisabraham/python3-midi.git.\n",

    "For step 3, you should learn how MIDI files are constructed. Below, we give a minimal explanation and some code for this particular project. For a more complete explanation, look for MIDI in your favorite search engine. Given this dataset, you can observe that it is monophonic (one note at a time) and there's a small delay (1 tick) inbetween each note. You could decide to ignore this delay or correct (recommanded) for it.\n",

Here, you will implement the first steps to translate this dataset in a language that can be read by your ANN models. To achieve that, we will later use the [one-hot encoding scheme](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/), which will associate each input (and output) unit of your network to a unique pitch or duration.

    "## Exercise 4: One-hot and zero-padding\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The last few steps to be able to feed (note by note) your music scores to a RNN model are\n",
    "1. Transform the sequence of integers into a sequence of vectors in the one-hot encoding scheme.\n",
    "2. Homegenize the length of each sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-hot encode** You can implement your own integer to one-hot code. For this use the numpy library and the suitable datatype. Alternatively, Keras provides a [built in one-hot encoding scheme](https://keras.io/utils/#to_categorical). After this step, for each melody, you should have two similar length matrices with one representing the sequence of note pitches and the other the sequence of note durations.\n",
    "1. Code the integer representation into matrices of one-hot vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-padding** Most deep learning libraries, including Keras, require that you specify the shape of the input data. As such, you cannot have variable length inputs per-se. The trick to handle them is [zero-padding](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/#pad_sequences). Provided with the [Masking Layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#masking) Keras will then ignore time steps where all inputs are 0.\n",
    "1. Extend the end of each melody matrices with vectors containing only zeros until all melodies have the same size. For simplicity, use the Keras pad_sequences function. There might be some rare very long melodies in your dataset, a possible choice is to set the 'maxlen' argument of pad_sequences to the mean+2std of the melody lengths. This ensure that 95% of your melodies would end before being truncated.\n",
    "2. Check and display the dimension of the resulting tensors. Typically, the tensor representing the sequence of pitches should be of shape [number of melodies x number of notes x number of entries in the pitch dictionary] and the tensor representing the sequence of durations [number of melodies x number of notes x number of entries in the duration dictionary]\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if this step was done correctly use the provided plotMelody function. For two randomly selected melodies, call the plotMelody function before and after one-hot/zero-pad. You should obtain the same plots (or slightly truncated if you randomly selected one belonging to 5% longest).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we strongly suggest that you save your preprocessed data now."

    "## Exercise 5: Building and training a generative model of  note transition with the Keras functional API\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras Sequential model is very efficient for fast prototyping, however suffers from a lack of design liberty. The Keras Functional API is only slightly more complex but allows for more control on the different parts of your model. You will be using the Functional API for the rest of this project. Please read carefully the [documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will be constructing your RNN model of note transition. To achieve that, your model should be trained to approximate the probability distribution of the upcoming note (observed as two output softmax layers - one for pitch and one for duration) given the current note (given as input) and the model internal representation of the history of notes (its hidden state). To achieve that, set the Keras RNN layer argument \"return_sequences\" to True when building your model. Doing this will give you an output for each note, rather than a single output at the end of the sequence. During training, the target at each time step is the next note pitch and duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use your own architecture but make sure to use at least 128 hidden units, Masking, and dropout to prevent overfitting. Your model should have two output (softmax) layers, one related to the pitch predictions that you should name `YP`, and the other related to the duration predictions `YT`. You should monitor both the loss (categorical_crossentropy) and the accuracy. For your best model, you should reach 40%/75% accuracy on the pitch/duration predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train your first model composed of SimpleRNN cells for min 250 epochs and save the model/parameters that lead to the higher accuracy on the validating set. Use a validation split of 0.2. Try  If you correctly named the output layers (`YP` and `YT`) use the provided `plotLearningCurves(History)` function to plot the learning curves by giving the History object returned by the Keras fit function as argument.  \n",
    "2. Train a second model where you replaced the SimpleRNN units with GRUs (LSTM unit equivalent that requires less parameters). Make sure you use the same hyperparameters as before. Plot the learning curves.\n",
    "3. On a single plot, adapt the `plotLearningCurves(History)` function to compare the validation learning curves of the simpleRNN and GRU models. In other words, plot the validation loss vs epoch for pitch/duration for the simpleRNN and GRU models. Do the same for accuracies.\n"

You can do that by starting with a random note, feeding it to your network and sample the output predictions in order to select the next note. Then add this note to your iteratively growing melodies. For your convenience, we provided the `sample` and `writeMIDI` functions. You can use the first in order to perform temperature sampling. The `writeMIDI` function allows you to write a MIDI file from the integer representation.\n",

    "4. Listen to 4 randomly chosen melodies (2 from the GRU model and 2 from the RNN model). To play in a notebook, use a similar approach as the one shown below assuming you have the files `GRU_1.mid` and `RNN_1.mid` at the same level as this notebook. For your own curiosity, you can also directly listen to the MIDI files with your favorite MIDI player but make sure that we can listen to the 4 extracts directly from this notebook (without rerunning it). You might have to use the \"Trust notebook\" button (in the top right corner) to see the players. This currently only works in jupyter notebook (not jupyter lab). If you have trouble achieving that, upload the MIDI files with your submission.\n",
    "5. (Optional) If you have a big enough computing power, try adding multiple and bigger layers. You could also try to improve your model with different add-ons, e.g. make your model learn when a melody ends, extend it to other datasets, ...\n",
    "6. (Optional) If you are happy with your results submit a 1 hour long generated MIDI file to the [AI-generated music challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/ai-generated-music-challenge). "
