    "# Miniproject 1: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the deepest traditions in learning about deep learning is to first [tackle the exciting problem of MNIST classification](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html). [The MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that was [recently extended](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373). We break with this tradition (just a little bit) and tackle first the related problem of classifying cropped, downsampled and grayscaled images of house numbers in the [The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/).\n",
    "- You should know the concepts \"multilayer perceptron\", \"stochastic gradient descent with minibatches\", \"training and validation data\", \"overfitting\" and \"early stopping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to define feedforward neural networks in keras and fit them to data.\n",
    "- You will be guided through a prototyping procedure for the application of deep learning to a specific domain.\n",
    "- You will get in contact with concepts discussed later in the lecture, like \"regularization\", \"batch normalization\" and \"convolutional networks\".\n",
    "- You will gain some experience on the influence of network architecture, optimizer and regularization choices on the goodness of fit.\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answer sentences. \n",
    "We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your names\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, please enter your full name(s) in the field below; they are used to load the data. The variable student2 may remain empty, if you work alone."
